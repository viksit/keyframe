# Zero to bot in 10 minutes

## Overview

Myraâ€™s APIs are the best way to build natural language understanding into your applications. They provide tools to identify user intent and extract key data like names, cities, numbers, and custom-defined categories.

In this tutorial, we'll build a straightforward and state-of-the-art conversational bot that will produce results like this:

```bash

> cancel my meeting with Jane tomorrow at 9pm
>>  Sure, I'll cancel the meeting for you with Jane at Mon, 17 Oct 2016 21:00:00 GMT.

> create a meeting with Jane and Joe next saturday at 17:00 hours
>>  I can help create a meeting for you with Jane and Joe at Sat, 22 Oct 2016 17:00:00 GMT.

```

## Step 1: Install the SDK

`pymyra` provides access to the Myra RESTful APIs. It currently supports `python 2.7`.

Using `pip`:
```bash
pip install python-myra
```

Or from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myralabs/python-myra
cd python-myra
pip install .
```

This will also install a sample configuration file into the following path `$HOME/.pymyra/settings.conf`.

## Step 2: Configure the SDK with your API credentials

- Register at http://api.myralabs.com/register
- When your account is opened, you'll receive an email with a link to the dashboard. 
- Log in to the dashboard and note the `account_id` and `account_secret`. Add those values into the appropriate places in the configuration file at`$HOME/.pymyra/settings.conf`.


## Step 3: Interact with CalendarBot

In the `python-myra` source directory, go to `tutorial/` and run `python tutorial.py`.

Meet CalendarBot! Ask it a question about creating or cancelling meetings.

```bash

python tutorial.py

calendar_bot>>  Welcome to calendar bot! I can help you create and cancel meetings. Try 'set up a meeting with Jane' or 'cancel my last meeting' to get started.

> cancel Jane's meeting with me tomorrow at 9pm
calendar_bot>>  Sure, I'll cancel the meeting for you with Jane at Mon, 17 Oct 2016 21:00:00 GMT.

> create a meeting with Jane and Joe next saturday at 17:00 hours
calendar_bot>>  I can help create a meeting for you with Jane and Joe at Sat, 22 Oct 2016 17:00:00 GMT.

```

## Step 4: Learn how CalendarBot is built

CalendarBot is built to understand questions about creating and cancelling calendar entries. Later, we'll add the ability to modify entries. (CalendarBot doesn't actually connect to a calendaring service, sorry!)

This tutorial ships with two sets of data files in the `tutorial/data` directory - `botv1` and `botv2`. Each directory contains two files - a training set and a testing set. A demo model for calendar queries has already been created for you by default using the `botv1/` dataset, and it's ID is `...`. [TODO: Greg]. This is what tutorial.py uses when you start.

Over the course of this tutorial, we'll walk you through extending the calendar bot to support one more piece of functionality - that of being able to modify existing calendar entries, by creating a model on Myra using the data in `botv2`, and extending tutorial.py in the right places.


Let's do a quick walkthrough of the code in `tutorial.py`.

`pymyra.api` contains the `client` module which we use to connect to the Myra API as described in the README which ships with the library.

```python
from pymyra.api import client

# Create the API config object from a configuration file
# This gets the config from /Users/<username>/.myra/settings.conf

CONF_FILE = join(expanduser('~'), '.pymyra', 'settings.conf')
config = client.get_config(CONF_FILE)

INTENT_MODEL_ID = "27c71fe414984927a32ff4d6684e0a73"

# Establish a global API connection
api = client.connect(config)
api.set_intent_model(INTENT_MODEL_ID)
```


If you now examine the `__main__` block, we initialize some bootstrap code which allows us to set up a command line interaction with our soon to be active bot.

```python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize the calendar bot class
    bot = CalendarBot()

    # Start a simple command line handler to process incoming messages
    # and return a response
    c = client.CmdLineHandler(bot)
    c.begin(startMessage=bot.welcome_message,
      botName="calendar_bot")

```

Let's step through how we implement `CalendarBot`.

The bot has a `process()` function which takes in a user input (in this case from the terminal), invokes the Myra API on it via `api.get(user_input)`, and then passes this to the action handler function. The result from this call is then printed out on the terminal.

```python

result = api.get(user_input)
message = self.actions.handle(result=result)
print("calendar_bot>> ", message)

```

The last part of this file is the `Actions` class. This contains a simple mapping of intents to action handlers. For instance, if the bot detects that the user is asking to create a meeting, it'll invoke the `create_handler()` function.

What's left then is to simply define each handler function. Here's the code for the `cancel_handler` function.

```python
 def cancel_handler(self, **kwargs):
        api_result = kwargs.get("result")
        e = api_result.entities.entity_dict.get("builtin", {})
        message = "Sure, I'll cancel the meeting for you"
        if "PERSON" in e:
            person = [i.get("text") for i in e.get("PERSON")]
            person_text = ""
            if len(person) > 1:
                person_text = " and ".join(person)
            else:
                person_text = person[0]
            message += " with %s" % person_text

        if "DATE" in e:
            tm = [i.get("date") for i in e.get("DATE")]
            tm_text = ""
            if len(tm) >= 1:
                tm_text = tm[0]
            message += " at %s." % (tm_text)
        return message
```

The function gets the result of the Myra API, and fetches the detected entities into `e`. If it finds a mention of a person and a time, it responds with a simple static message constructed appropriately.



## Step 5: Extend CalendarBot to handle meeting modifications


- Train a new model on Myra using `data/botv2`.
- Change the intent model ID with the new ID

- Create a new entry in `self.intent_map` in the `Actions` class
```python
{
..,
..,
"modify": self.modify_handler
}
```

- Define a new function called `modify_handler` in the `Actions` class.

```python
 def modify_handler(self, **kwargs):
        api_result = kwargs.get("result")
        e = api_result.entities.entity_dict.get("builtin", {})
        message = "Sure, I can modify the meeting for you"
        if "PERSON" in e:
            person = [i.get("text") for i in e.get("PERSON")]
            person_text = ""
            if len(person) > 1:
                person_text = " and ".join(person)
            else:
                person_text = person[0]
            message += " with %s" % person_text

        if "DATE" in e:
            tm = [i.get("date") for i in e.get("DATE")]
            tm_text = ""
            if len(tm) >= 1:
                tm_text = tm[0]
            message += " at %s." % (tm_text)
        return message

```

Run `tutorial.py` again and try with the following sentence,
