# Myra tutorial -- Zero to bot in 10 minutes

## Overview

Myraâ€™s APIs are the best way to build natural language understanding into your applications. They provide tools to identify user intent and extract key data like names, cities, numbers, and custom-defined values.

We'll build a simple and state-of-the-art conversational bot that will do this:

```bash

> cancel my meeting with Jane tomorrow at 9pm
>>  Sure, I'll cancel the meeting for you with Jane at Mon, 17 Oct 2016 21:00:00 GMT.

> create a meeting with Jane and Joe next saturday at 17:00 hours
>>  I can help create a meeting for you with Jane and Joe at Sat, 22 Oct 2016 17:00:00 GMT.

```

## Step 1: Install the SDK

`pymyra` provides access to the Myra RESTful APIs. It currently supports `python 2.7`.

Using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pymyra
```

Or from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/myralabs/pymyra
cd pymyra
pip install .
```

This will also install a sample configuration file into the following path `$HOME/.pymyra/settings.conf`.

## Step 2: Configure the SDK with your API credentials

- Register at http://api.myralabs.com/register
- When your account is opened, you'll receive an email with a link to the dashboard. 
- Log in to the dashboard and note the `account_id` and `account_secret`. Add those values into the appropriate places in the configuration file at`$HOME/.pymyra/settings.conf`.


## Step 3: Interact with CalendarBot

In the `pymyra` source directory, go to `tutorial/` and run `python tutorial.py`.

Meet CalendarBot! Ask it a question about creating or cancelling meetings.

```bash

python tutorial.py

calendar_bot>>  Welcome to calendar bot! I can help you create and cancel meetings. Try 'set up a meeting with Jane' or 'cancel my last meeting' to get started.

> cancel Jane's meeting with me tomorrow at 9pm
calendar_bot>>  Sure, I'll cancel the meeting for you with Jane at Mon, 17 Oct 2016 21:00:00 GMT.

> create a meeting with Jane and Joe next saturday at 17:00 hours
calendar_bot>>  I can help create a meeting for you with Jane and Joe at Sat, 22 Oct 2016 17:00:00 GMT.

```

## Step 4: Learn how CalendarBot is built

CalendarBot understands questions about creating and cancelling calendar entries. Later, we'll add the ability to modify entries. (CalendarBot doesn't actually connect to a calendaring service, sorry!)

CalendarBot is connected to pre-trained models that determine the user's intent -- the 'thing' they are trying to accomplish -- and the user's entities -- information in the sentence you need to carry out the user's task. We've included the training data for these models in `tutorial/data/botv1`.

### The model

The files are divided into two portions called `train` and `test`. The Myra model will learn based off the sentences in `train` and use the sentences in `test` to evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data. 

*botv1_train.tsv:*
```
utterance	intent
meeting with Kevin and John next tuesday 5pm	create
hang next week	create
let's meet up next week sometime	create
meeting with the team 10/24 in Guitar Hero	create
let's get everybody together	create
...
```
*botv1_test.tsv:*
```
utterance	intent
meet with steve and andy on weds	create
get together next friday	create
dinner on oct 25	create
set a meeting with everyone at 5pm	create
...
```
The train file has 12 utterances for `create` and 11 for `cancel`. We recommend at least 7-10 utterances for training files, and 3-5 for test files. Curious how it works? In Step 5, we'll walk through adding a new intent to the model and to the bot.

### The bot
`pymyra.api` contains the `client` module which we use to connect to the Myra API.

```python
from pymyra.api import client

# Create the API config object from a configuration file
# This gets the config from /Users/<username>/.myra/settings.conf

CONF_FILE = join(expanduser('~'), '.pymyra', 'settings.conf')
config = client.get_config(CONF_FILE)

INTENT_MODEL_ID = "xxxxx"

# Establish a global API connection
api = client.connect(config)
api.set_intent_model(INTENT_MODEL_ID)
```
In the `__main__` block, we initialize bootstrap code to set up a command line interaction.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize the calendar bot class
    bot = CalendarBot()

    # Start a simple command line handler to process incoming messages
    # and return a response
    c = client.CmdLineHandler(bot)
    c.begin(startMessage=bot.welcome_message,
      botName="calendar_bot")
```
Let's step through how we implement `CalendarBot`.

The `process()` function takes in a user input, invokes the Myra API on it via `api.get(user_input)`, and then passes this to the action handler function. The result from this call is then printed out on the terminal.

```python
result = api.get(user_input)
message = self.actions.handle(result=result)
print("calendar_bot>> ", message)
```
The last part of this file is the `Actions` class. This contains a simple mapping of intents to action handlers. For instance, if the bot detects that the user is asking to create a meeting, it'll invoke the `create_handler()` function.

Next, we define each handler function. Here's the code for the `cancel_handler`:

```python
 def cancel_handler(self, **kwargs):
        api_result = kwargs.get("result")
        e = api_result.entities.entity_dict.get("builtin", {})
        message = "Sure, I'll cancel the meeting for you"
        if "PERSON" in e:
            person = [i.get("text") for i in e.get("PERSON")]
            person_text = ""
            if len(person) > 1:
                person_text = " and ".join(person)
            else:
                person_text = person[0]
            message += " with %s" % person_text

        if "DATE" in e:
            tm = [i.get("date") for i in e.get("DATE")]
            tm_text = ""
            if len(tm) >= 1:
                tm_text = tm[0]
            message += " at %s." % (tm_text)
        return message
```

The function gets the result of the Myra API, and fetches the detected entities into `e`. If it finds a mention of a person and a time, it will include those in the response message.

## Step 5: Train and extend CalendarBot to handle something new
Now, let's add the ability to modify meetings to the Myra API and then to the bot. 

### Train the model to recognize the modify intent
In `tutorial/data/botv2`, we've included new utterances for the intent `modify`. Check them out now:

*botv2_train.tsv:*
```
...
change the time of the meeting with deepak	modify
do the meeting with Jane at 1pm instead	modify
switch the 1:1 to 9am on tuesday	modify
```
The model was pretrained for the `create` and `cancel` intents; now, we'll upload and train the model ourselves to add the `modify` intent. To do so, go to the "Intent Models" section of the Myra dashboard. 
* Create a new model named `tutorial_botv2` and click the green plus icon.
* Upload `botv2_train.tsv` into the Train section and `botv2_test.tsv` into the Test section, and hit Save and Train.
* The model will take a few minutes to train. Once the status says 'Ready', copy the intent model's ID over to `INTENT_MODEL_ID` in `tutorial.py`. 

### Add modify to the bot
Create a new entry in `self.intent_map` in the `Actions` class:
```python
{
..,
"modify": self.modify_handler
}
```
Next, define a new function called `modify_handler` in the `Actions` class.
```python
 def modify_handler(self, **kwargs):
        api_result = kwargs.get("result")
        e = api_result.entities.entity_dict.get("builtin", {})
        message = "Sure, I can modify the meeting for you"
        if "PERSON" in e:
            person = [i.get("text") for i in e.get("PERSON")]
            person_text = ""
            if len(person) > 1:
                person_text = " and ".join(person)
            else:
                person_text = person[0]
            message += " with %s" % person_text

        if "DATE" in e:
            tm = [i.get("date") for i in e.get("DATE")]
            tm_text = ""
            if len(tm) >= 1:
                tm_text = tm[0]
            message += " at %s." % (tm_text)
        return message

```

Run `tutorial.py` again, and ask the bot: "change my meeting with Scott to Tuesday", or whatever you want! Now, you have a bot that you've taught to understand complex input related to creating, modifying, and cancelling meetings. 


```
# update me
```

## Next steps

You've made it! You now have a simple bot capable of understanding complex sentences related to creating, modifying, and canceling calendar entries. Next, try creating a new intent model for your own topics by adding sample utterances into the calendar data files.
